## Bio 

I am Department Chair and Professor in [the Department of Electrical and Computer
Engineering](https://uah.edu/eng/departments/ece) at [the University of Alabama in
Huntsville](https://www.uah.edu). 
I received my Ph.D., M.S., and Dipl. Ing. degrees from the University of Belgrade, Serbia in 1999, 1997, and 1994, respectively.
I joined UAH in 2001. Before that, I held academic positions at [the Dublin
City University](https://dcu.ie) in Dublin, Ireland (2000-2001) and at [the School of
Electrical Engineering](https://www.etf.bg.ac.rs), The Univeristy of Belgrade (1994-2000). 

My research interests span the areas of computer architecture, energy-efficient computing, 
embedded systems, wireless sensor networks, and hardware design. 
In particular my research focuses on non-volatile memories, hardware-oriented security, 
architectures for ensuring code and data integrity and confidentiality (a.k.a., secure processors), 
architectures for increased programmers' productivity and debuggability, and memory hierarchy optimizations. 
I am also interested in developing new applications and systems for ubiquitous personal health monitoring (a.k.a., mHealth systems). 
I lead [the LaCASA Laboratory](http://lacasa.uah.edu) and co-lead [the mHealth
Laboratory](http://portal.mhealth.uah.edu).
With my students and collaborators I have published over 140 peer-reviewed journal and conference articles and hold two U.S. patents.
My papers have been cited over 6,900 times (as of March 2023).
